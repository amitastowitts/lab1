# hello!
## welcome to my about me page
### my name is Amita
#### and I'm a second year CS and environmental systems student

**some of my _non-school_ hobbies include** **reading**, *dancing*, ~~sleeping~~, writing, and ***playing soccer***.

I like reading all sorts of genres, and my top books right now are:
1. Dread Nation (alternate historical fiction/horror)

2. Orion Lost (sci-fi)

3. Six of Crows (fantasy/heist)

I dance on one of UCSD's dance teams. here's our most recent [performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8x867GC0QBI) :D

just as Julius Caesar once said,
> I am learning computer science.

I'm most comfortable with `Java`
```
public static void main(String[] args) {
    // etc.
}
```
but the list of languages I know at least somewhat is:
- Java
- C++
- C
- Python
- English
- French

here's my [readme file!](README.md)

And now I get to check lab 1 off my homework list!
- [x] lab 1
- [ ] all my other assignments :)
